@@In recent news, a bold and unprecedented attack was carried out by the Palestinian militant group Hamas against Israel.
This egregious assault involved approximately 3,000 assailants infiltrating Israeli territory,
resulting in numerous casualties, including both soldiers and civilians. Dozens of hostages were also abducted.
The attack has been marked by extreme brutality, with disturbing reports of massacres, beheadings, sexual violence,
and the use of civilians as human shields. These actions have been widely condemned as war crimes and crimes against
