# auto-post-classifier

## Dev Env Setup

Run `poetry install` from the root of the project.
This should get you all you need.

## Run the script

The script should be installed as an executable in the environment created by `poetry` (see above).
It is possible to run the script in one of two ways:

### Directly

```
poetry run python auto_post_classifier/main.py
```

Use this method during dev.

### Indirectly

First start the environment with `poetry shell` executed from the project's root directory and then simply execute `auto-post-classifier`
